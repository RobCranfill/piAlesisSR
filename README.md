# piAlesisSR
A way to select different drum kits ("kit" in the sense of "collections of sounds"), when using a MIDI drum kit ("kit" in the sense of a physical set of surfaces to be beat upon; an Alesis DM6, in my case) to send notes to an external drum machine (an Alesis SR18 for me).

This is Yet Another Solution to my ongoing quest (see my other projects, [MIDIBox](https://github.com/RobCranfill/midiBox), [PowerOff](https://github.com/RobCranfill/poweroff), and [MIDITrans](https://github.com/RobCranfill/miditrans)) to be able to easily and on the fly select "nice" drum kits.
